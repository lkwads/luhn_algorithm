# Luhn Algorithm Validator (C++)

A simple C++ console application that checks if a number (like a credit card or CIN) is valid using the Luhn algorithm.
It processes the digits, applies checksum logic, and tells the user whether the number is valid or not.

# How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o luhn
# Run the executable
./luhn
#  Example
Enter card number: 4111111111111112
Card number is invalid!
